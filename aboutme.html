<h1>Meet Christina Low</h1>

<h2>[About me]</h2>
<p>Hi there! Nice to meet you! I'm Christina Low, a 17 year-old rising senior living in Queens, New York City.
  I am a Malaysian- American who is passionate in changing society for the better.</p>

<h2>Reflection- 7/19/17</h2>
<p>- Based on what I've learned so far, some similarities between Python and Scratch are that there are similar functions, for instance a function that repeats commands forever.
  However, unlike Scracth, Python uses different names (the function to repeat something forever is called "While True"). Additionally, the code is in lines rather than blocks.
  This makes it harder to visualize the specific commands. One upside of using Python, though, is that when an error results, it is easy to figure out what is wrong with the code.
  Python will tell us what kind of error it is and where the error is located. In Scratch, we had to keep on guessing and playing around to fix to error.</p>
<p>- Today, we spent some time to debug our program. It felt new and interesting, seeing how Scratch and Python were connected and seeing a different way of doing the same "Draw Shapes" project.
  It was somewhat hard as it took some time to get used to the new commands.</p>
<h2>Reflection- 7/21/17</h2>
<p>- Today, we learned about data structures. A list is one kind of data structure that stores data.
  Lists are not limited to one data type and can include strings, integers, and floats.
  They are useful since instead of going through every element in the list and doing a command to each one, you can do a command to the entire list.
  For instance, today we used a list of pixels from an image and recolored them based on the total RGB value.
  Instead of going through each value, we recolored a range of numbers. </p>
<p>- Today, I worked with Hannah. I think we worked well together, finding different colors and filters, and asking each other questions when we got stuck.
  I have worked with various partners this week and it reminded me of the four communication styles we had a speaker come to talk to us about. It's interesting to see how people of different communication styles work together.
  As an idea-centered person, I think I work best with other idea-centered people as well as processing-centered people.</p>
