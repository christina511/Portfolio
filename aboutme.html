<h2>Reflection- 7/19/17</h2>
<p>- Based on what I've learned so far, some similarities between Python and Scratch are that there are similar functions, for instance a function that repeats commands forever.
  However, unlike Scracth, Python uses different names (the function to repeat something forever is called "While True"). Additionally, the code is in lines rather than blocks.
  This makes it harder to visualize the specific commands. One upside of using Python, though, is that when an error results, it is easy to figure out what is wrong with the code.
  Python will tell us what kind of error it is and where the error is located. In Scratch, we had to keep on guessing and playing around to fix to error.</p>
<p>- Today, we spent some time to debug our program. It felt new and interesting, seeing how Scratch and Python were connected and seeing a different way of doing the same "Draw Shapes" project.
  It was somewhat hard as it took some time to get used to the new commands.</p>
